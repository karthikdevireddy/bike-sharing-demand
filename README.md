Prediction of Bike Hourly Bike Rentals - Kaggle Competition

Using a training and test set from Kaggle, this notebook goes step-by-step through an EDA and PDA to develop a model that predicts demand 
of hourly bike rentals. 

The best results were obtained using Ensemble Gradient Descent, but the notebook also includes:
1. Linear Regression
2. Neural Network
3. Random Forests
6. XGBoost Regression
7. A brief overview of an LSTM attempt
